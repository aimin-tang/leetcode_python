My own attempts on solving leetcode easy/medium problems.
Coding is done in Python.
Test-Driven Development with pytest, for steady progress, and quick refactoring work.

============
To run test:
============
```
git clone <repo>
cd leetcode_python
pipenv shell --python 3.10-dev
pipenv install
export PYTHONPATH=solved/src
pytest -v solved/tests
```
