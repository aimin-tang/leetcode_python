=============
This project:
=============
My own attempt on solving leetcode easy and medium problems, to practice my Python skills.

For all problems, TDD is used with pytest. This is for steady progress, and quick verification on refactoring work.

=================
Where things are:
=================
Problem in progress always has two files, one in src/, one in tests/.

For example, when I was working on #15, 3Sum:

./solved/src:
< problems solved before >

./solved/tests:
< problems solved before >

./src:
three_sum_15.py   <= source file for current problem

./tests:
test_three_sum_15.py    <= test file for current problem

=================================
To run test (on solved problems):
=================================
```
git clone <repo>
cd leetcode_python
pipenv shell --python 3.10-dev
pipenv install
export PYTHONPATH=solved/src
pytest -v solved/tests
```
